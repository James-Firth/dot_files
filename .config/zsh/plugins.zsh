# Define your plugins here!
# MUST be defined per machine. `git` will be added as a default


# Which plugins would you like to load?
# Standard plugins can be found in $ZSH/plugins/
# Custom plugins may be added to $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.

# This variable will be accessible because we are sourcing
plugins=(git docker docker-compose)
